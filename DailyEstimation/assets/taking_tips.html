<p>These tips will help you take better pictures of your receipts and allow the built in Optical
    Character Recognition engine in our app to attempt to read values on your receipts to save you
    some typing.</p>

<p>You do not need to follow these tips if you are not interested in using the built in OCR engine
    within the app.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of OCR, using OCR is simple, when you scan a receipt, the OCR
    engine will automatically try to read your receipt. You will find an OCR button on the following
    screen offering you values it reads to choose from. OCR is not an exact science, there may be
    multiple choices, some or all may be incorrect, or there may be no choices at all, depending on
    how well you follow these tips.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Sunlight is better than indoor light.</li>
    <li>If you use indoor light, make sure you have strong, bright light above the receipt, with no
        shadows.
    </li>
    <li>Do not use your flash.</li>
    <li>Remove as many wrinkles as possible from the receipt.</li>
    <li>Take the picture as close as possible, capturing only the part of the receipt which has the
        info you need.
    </li>
    <li>Fill the camera fully with the receipt when taking the picture.</li>
    <li>Take the picture vertically, not horizontally.</li>
    <li>To save time make sure you have names and categories setup so you don't have to type them
        every time.
    </li>
</ol>
